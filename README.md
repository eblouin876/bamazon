## Support
If you come across any bugs or have any suggestions to improve the code, please feel free to comment! I would love to improve the code and I'm very new to writing my own promisies.

## Project Status
This project is part of a web development program I am currently enrolled in and is in the works. I will continue to improve upon it over the next few months. Directions at the moment include: 
* Figuring out why manager and supervisor will quit out of the entire program after you run through the one of the functions
* Cleaning up customer2.js
